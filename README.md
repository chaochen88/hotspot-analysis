# hotspot-analysis
to detect if there is any mosquito hotspots in Sanibel and Captiva island, we analyzed trap data collected by Lee county mosquito control district;
the purpose is just to test if the Getis-ord statistic can be used to detect hotspot;
the code tested data from 2019 and 2020 for Aedes aegypti;
with only 58 traps, the statistic result may not reliable but only provide examples how to perform such statitics when coordinates and traps availiable.
