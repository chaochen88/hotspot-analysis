# hotspot-analysis
to detect if there are any mosquito hotspots in Sanibel and Captiva Island, we analyzed trap data collected by Lee County Mosquito Control District;
the purpose is to test if the Getis-ord statistic can be used to detect hotspots;
the code tested data from 2019 and 2020 for Aedes aegypti;
with only 58 traps, the statistical result may not be reliable but only provides examples of performing such statistics when coordinates and traps are available.
